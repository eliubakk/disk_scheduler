Call cpu::boot(thread_startfunc_t func, void *arg, unsigned int deterministic); once. func is a function that takes arg as an argument. The cpu will run deterministically if not set to zero.

Disk scheduler can contain at most max_disk_queue requests.
A number of requester threads and one service thread. 
A requester thread must wait until the service threads handles its request before it can issue its next request
The service thread will pick the request that is closest to its current track.
Disk is initialized with its track to 0.
Service thread should only handle a request when the disk queue is full. The disk queue is full when equal to max_disk_queue, or equal to the number of requester threads if the number of requester threads is less than max_disk_queue.

Command line Input:
	max_disk_queue
	[list of input files]

Input file:
	each line specifies the track number of the request (0 to 999)

Output:
	print_request(requester, track) after a requester issues a request.
	print_service(requester, track) after a request is serviced.
